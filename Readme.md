I am excited to showcase my achievement in  **CodSoft** 's Task 1 â€“ an immersive exploration into data science through Titanic Survival Prediction. Under the guidance of CodSoft, I delved into data, engineered features, and evaluated models, gaining a comprehensive understanding of the entire process.

## ðŸ“Š Checkpoints on the journey to completion:

* **Data Collection & Processing:** Successfully loaded the Titanic dataset, addressed missing values, and unveiled insights through thorough exploration.
* **Data Analysis & Visualization:** Illustrated survival patterns across classes, genders, and embarkation points, establishing a foundation for effective feature engineering.
* **Feature Engineering:** Skillfully transformed categorical columns, prepared data for predictive modeling, ensuring the readiness of features.
* **Modeling & Evaluation:** Employed robust classifiers (Random Forest and Decision Tree) to forecast survival, providing accuracy assessments and detailed reports.
* **Sharing Insights ðŸŽ¯:** Concluded with insightful observations and performance visualizations, providing a clear perspective on predictive capabilities.
