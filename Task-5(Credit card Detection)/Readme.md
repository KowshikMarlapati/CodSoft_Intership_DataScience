# Credit Card Fraud Detection

I am thrilled to present my achievement in CodSoft's Task 5 – a fascinating journey into the realm of data science, specifically centered around Credit Card Fraud Detection. Under CodSoft's guidance, I immersed myself in pivotal aspects such as data analysis, preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation, all aimed at contributing to the crucial field of fraud prevention.

## Key Achievements:

1. **Library Utilization:** Leveraged essential libraries, including pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn, to streamline data analysis, visualization, and modeling processes.
2. **Data Collection & Processing:** Collected and meticulously processed the credit card transactions dataset, revealing insights into its attributes and characteristics.
3. **Visual Insight:** Employed potent visualization techniques to gain a visual understanding of transaction distribution, spotlighting both fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions. Explored the correlation between transaction amounts and classes.
4. **Feature & Target Segmentation:** Isolated critical features (excluding 'Class') and the target variable ('Class') in preparation for subsequent modeling.
5. **Train-Test Data Division:** Thoughtfully partitioned the data into training and testing sets, a crucial step to ensure accurate model evaluation.
6. **Model Training & Evaluation:** Trained two distinct models – Logistic Regression and RandomForestClassifier – tailor-made for fraud detection. Evaluated the performance of these models using accuracy scores and comprehensive classification reports.

This model stands as a guardian, actively protecting financial transactions by adeptly identifying and preventing credit card fraud. Its role is pivotal in ensuring the security and trustworthiness of payment systems, thereby fortifying the integrity of financial transactions.
